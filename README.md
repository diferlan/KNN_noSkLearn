# KNN_noSkLearn
The algorithm chosen is a simple KNN algorithm, the program also includes MinMax Scaling to avoid dealing to distorted results caused by bigger values.

This repository contains 2 files:
  1. retrouresti_knn.py: This file, when ran, automatically iniciates the algorith usign the dataset determined in the code (stroke_data.csv). You only need to run it and it will automatically make the predicitons using said dataset and will print the predicitions, the accuracy and the total of correct predictions.
  2. stroke_data.csv: This is the dataset chosen to test the algorithm, it most be in the same folder as the .py file in order to run smoothly
